# Object-Detection-for-Visually-Impaired-Person
---> Our first step is to detect the objects in the image captured by the blind person from their mobile camera for that purpose we are using YOLO V3.( presently we are using webcam for that)
---> After detecting the objects we need to convert the textin the image to speech which helps the visually impaired to know about their environment.
---> We are using Pytesseract for extracting the text from the image.

Things to be downloaded:
 1. YOLO V3 weights.
 2. Coco.names
 3. Tesseract (latest version)
